# Project Abel | Delhi Council of Child Welfare

## Project Overview

**Project Abel** is an initiative to develop and implement innovative **assistive technologies** aimed at improving the lives of specially-abled individuals. Through a series of prototypes, this project focuses on addressing real-world challenges faced by these individuals by creating user-friendly solutions that can be effectively integrated into daily life.

The project was successfully implemented at the **Delhi Council of Child Welfare Centre**, where we deployed the following key technologies:

1. **Magic Switch**: A socket automation tool to control electrical devices with ease.
2. **TalkAbel**: A solution designed to convert hand gestures into readable text, providing a voice for those who have difficulty speaking.
3. **Weihenmeyer**: An obstacle detection tool for individuals with visual impairments, helping them navigate their environment safely.

## Key Features

### 1. Magic Switch
Magic Switch is designed to automate electrical sockets, making it easier for users to control household appliances and devices. It is tailored to individuals with limited mobility, allowing them to manage tasks such as turning on lights or fans with minimal effort.

- **Key Benefits**: Enhances independence for users with mobility challenges.
- **Technology**: Integrates **IoT** and **wireless control systems**.

### 2. TalkAbel
TalkAbel facilitates communication for those who rely on **sign language** or hand gestures. It converts **gestures into text**, enabling communication between specially-abled individuals and those unfamiliar with sign language.

- **Key Benefits**: Empowers non-verbal individuals by bridging the communication gap.
- **Technology**: Utilizes **gesture recognition sensors** and **text conversion algorithms**.

### 3. Weihenmeyer
This assistive device helps individuals with visual impairments by detecting obstacles in their path, improving their **mobility** and **independence**. It alerts the user to nearby objects, ensuring safer navigation in unfamiliar environments.

- **Key Benefits**: Ensures safer movement and reduces accidents.
- **Technology**: Uses **ultrasonic sensors** and **haptic feedback systems**.

## Implementation & Impact

The prototypes were successfully implemented at the **Delhi Council of Child Welfare Centre**. The impact of these assistive technologies has been transformative, providing specially-abled individuals with greater autonomy and improving their quality of life.

### Achievements:
- **Pioneered the development** of assistive technologies with a user-first approach.
- **Successfully executed and deployed** these technologies at a welfare center, benefiting numerous individuals.
- Received **positive feedback** from users and caretakers, highlighting the practical benefits of the solutions.

## Future Scope

The next steps for Project Abel include:
- **Scaling up** the deployment of these solutions to more centers and institutions across India.
- **Further development** of these technologies with the integration of **AI and machine learning** to make the devices smarter and more adaptive to individual needs.
- **Customization** for specific user needs based on feedback from users and caretakers.
